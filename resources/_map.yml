# _map.yml - File Mapping Configuration
#
# PURPOSE:
# This configuration file defines how resources are mapped and copied by the CLI
# from their source locations to target destinations in the repository.
#
# STRUCTURE:
# The file uses a 'mappings' list where each entry represents a file to be copied.
#
# FIELDS:
# - legible-name: Human-readable identifier for the mapping (for logs and reference)
# - source: Path to the source file, relative to where the _map.yml file is located
# - destination: Target location where the file should be copied
#
# DESTINATION PATHS:
# - When specifying 'next-enterprise/' as the destination, this refers to the ROOT 
#   of the next-enterprise repository where the CLI is being executed
# - You can specify subdirectories like 'next-enterprise/some-directory/another-directory' 
#   and the CLI will create these directories as needed, relative to the repository root
# - Paths are always normalized according to the operating system standards
#
# EXAMPLES:
# - A destination of 'next-enterprise/' copies directly to the root
# - A destination of 'next-enterprise/config/' copies to a 'config' directory in the root
# - A destination of 'next-enterprise/src/utils/' creates and copies to nested directories

    destination: next-enterprise/
    
  - legible-name: Docker Compose
    source: ./docker-compose.yml
    destination: next-enterprise/

  - legible-name: Dockerfile
    source: ./Dockerfile
    destination: next-enterprise/

  - legible-name: npmrc
    source: ./.npmrc
    destination: next-enterprise/
