# _map.yml - File Mapping Configuration
#
# PURPOSE:
# This configuration file defines how resources are mapped and copied by the CLI
# from their source locations to target destinations in the repository.
#
# STRUCTURE:
# The file uses a 'mappings' list where each entry represents a file to be copied.
#
# FIELDS:
# - legible-name: Human-readable identifier for the mapping (for logs and reference)
# - source: Path to the source file, relative to where the _map.yml file is located
# - destination: Target location where the file should be copied
#
# SPECIAL VALUES:
# - ${next-enterprise}: This special value represents the current working directory (CWD)
#   where the CLI is being executed. Note that the CLI can ONLY be run from within the
#   next-enterprise repository root directory.
#
# DESTINATION PATHS:
# - All destinations are relative to the current working directory (where the CLI is run)
# - Using ${next-enterprise}/ is equivalent to ./ and refers to the repository root
# - You can specify subdirectories like ${next-enterprise}/some-directory/ and the CLI
#   will create these directories as needed
# - Absolute paths are not recommended but can be used if necessary
# - Paths are always normalized according to the operating system standards
#
# EXAMPLES:
# - destination: ${next-enterprise}/             # Copies to the repository root
# - destination: ${next-enterprise}/config/      # Copies to a 'config' directory
# - destination: ${next-enterprise}/src/utils/   # Creates and copies to nested directories
# - destination: ./                              # Alternative syntax for repository root
# - destination: ./config/                       # Alternative syntax for subdirectory
#
# EXECUTION CONTEXT:
# The CLI tool must be executed from within the next-enterprise repository root.
# All destination paths are resolved relative to this execution context.
